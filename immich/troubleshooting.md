# ios photos are auto cropped + smaller when auto uploaded to immich

A 1:1 comparison of photos downloading an original photo from iCloud comparing to a photo that was auto uploaded to immich and then downloaded.

Immich downloaded = from bytes to MB smaller than the original downloaded from iCloud

Does not happen on Android devices

Tested on an iPhone and Pixel

## causes

- "[optimize storage](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254871423?sortBy=rank)" enabled on device

## solutions

- download originals and upload manually to immich
- download originals, re-import to Photos via Mac
